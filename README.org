* cl-rrt

Common Lisp implementation of RRT (Rapidily exploring Random Tree), a fast probabilistic multidimentional path-plannning algorithm. Note: It will still work, but it is an old work. I think the implementation is not be very efficient because my lisp hacking has significantly improved since when I wrote this library.
